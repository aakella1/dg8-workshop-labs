Click-to-Copy
You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
